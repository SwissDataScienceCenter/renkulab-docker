# Images with VSCodium

The devcontainer images here are a great base for this:
https://hub.docker.com/r/microsoft/vscode-devcontainers

They do not contain vscode in them. They contain an executable
that is called `code` but that is just a shell script that
prints a message that VSCode is not installed.
